# Golden Nature Homestay – Single Page Website

An elegant, responsive single-page site for a premium farmhouse homestay near Malpe Beach. Built with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, Swiper.js, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Structure
- `index.html` – Main page with sections: Hero, Gallery, Features, Location, Contact.
- `style.css` – Custom styling, colors, typography, animations, bottom navbar.
- `script.js` – Swiper hero slider, smooth scroll, nav highlight, lightbox, animations, contact actions.
- `assets/` – Add all images here with the exact filenames referenced.

## Setup
1. Place images inside `assets/` using the same names:
   - `logo.png`, `hero-1.jpg` … `hero-4.jpg`
   - `gallery-1.jpg` … `gallery-9.jpg`
2. Update contact numbers in `script.js`:
   - Set `phoneNumber` and `whatsappNumber` to real values.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step required.

## Customization
- Swap hero or gallery images by replacing files in `assets/` with the same names.
- Edit headlines, taglines, and text directly in `index.html`.
- Adjust colors or spacing in `style.css`.

## Notes
- Bottom navbar is fixed and mobile-friendly with smooth scrolling and active state.
- Images use lazy loading; gallery opens a lightweight lightbox on click.
- Page is ready for hosting and SEO indexing with schema metadata included.
